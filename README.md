<p>
This stage is when a new ticket is created. Two common ways in which tickets can be submitted is through a form – such as the one shown here – or by emailing an email address that is designated for tickets. In this form, the user/customer provides their contact information, the topic/issue, and details about the issue.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Stage 2: Assignment</h2>
<p> 
Once the ticket has been submitted, the ticket can be assigned to an IT professional. in our case, to properly handled the ticket, information regarding the level of severity has been changed. The Priority was changed to “Emergency,” the SLA Plan was changed to “SEV-A,” and the Department was changed to “System Administrators.” The ticket was also assigned to “Jane Doe,” who is an administrator.

<p>
<h2>Stage 3: Working the Issue</h2>
<p> 
Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and people, the IT staff can work on finding a solution to the issue. Each time a change is made to the ticket or there is an update to the situation, a comment can be made in the Ticket Thread. This allows everyone viewing the ticket to be aware of what has already done and facilitates communication between everyone involved.

</p>
<h2>Stage 4: Resolution</h2>
<p> 
When the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. Now the ticket will move from the Open section to the Closed section. As an IT professionals, it is a good pratice to browse closed tickets since they can be a "big library"  to find solutions to open tickets.
